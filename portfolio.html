        <h2>About Me!</h2>
            <p>My name is Liane Mark B. Asadon and I am currently pursuing a degree in information technology at Rizal Technological University, 
                one of the leading institutions in the Philippines. As the eldest of my three siblings, I have always been responsible and ambitious, 
                striving to excel in my academic and personal endeavors. My passion is web development and computer programming, and I aspire to become a successful professional in these fields in the near future. 
                I believe that web development and computer programming are not only rewarding careers, but also powerful tools to create beautiful technologies that can improve the quality of life for people around the world. 
                That is why I am eager to learn new skills and technologies, and to apply them in innovative and meaningful ways.

        <p>This project is a calculator application that I developed using Java programming language.<br> 
            It is the most amazing project I have ever done because I built it from scratch and acquired many new skills and knowledge from it.<br>
        </p>
        <img src="C:\Users\liane\OneDrive\Documents\New folder (2)\picture\portfolio2.jpg">
        <p>This project is an employee database that I created with the help of various online resources, such as YouTube tutorials.<br>
             It was a challenging task for me because I was not very familiar with the concepts and tools involved,<br> 
             but I managed to overcome the difficulties and complete the project successfully.
